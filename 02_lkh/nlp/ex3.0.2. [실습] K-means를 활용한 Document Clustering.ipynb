the 255W routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use I discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .\\n26

                                              I've used it around town and find it to be extremely accurate .\\n28

.\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A lot of my friends' addresses are inaccurate by any GPS .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                        It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n31                                                                                                                            Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

this one .\\n36

  The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

                                                                                            After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                    It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .\\n42

the travelling time accurately .\\n43                                                                                                                          Accuracy is as good as any other unit, they all sometimes tell you you have arrived when you haven't, or continue to tell you to turn when you're already there .\\n44

the maps .\\n45

airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                    The Garmin is loaded with very accurate maps that generally know the roads in even the remotest areas .\\n49                                                        I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n50

                           It does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .\\n38         After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .\\n39                                                   My my, I have never experienced such smooth

driving 91 Camry for long time and it's quality deeply impressed me .\\n68                                                                                                                                         While I love the design, the poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question the quality of any future Toyota vehicle .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                         I love the car's visual and aesthetic design, but quality is just as important and for that reason, I would NOT recommend the new Camry to anyone !\\n70

would NOT recommend the new Camry to anyone !\\n70
